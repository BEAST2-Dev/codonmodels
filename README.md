# Codon Models

Models describing evolution at the codon level allow 
the estimation of measures of the selective forces 
acting on proteins 
([Kosiol et. al. 2000](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-abstract/24/7/1464/986344)). 

The current implementation is M0 proposed in 
[Yang et al. 2000](http://www.genetics.org/content/155/1/431.short)
